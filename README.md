ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Kunal Kaushik, a sophomore at the National Institute of Technology, Hamirpur, in India!
ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Machine Learning and Robotics, and aspire for a future career exploring an intersection between the two fields.
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the Robot Operating System (ROS), and am continually trying to improve my skills building efficient deep, convolutional, or recurrent neural networks, and LSTMs using TensorFlow!
ðŸ“« How to reach me ...

 NOTE: The Machine Learning code currently up on my repositories was a part of my first two projects ever implementing Machine Learning! I am very proud of the effort put in to meet the deadlines, and although the results could have been much better, cut me some slack!!
